Report Abstract:
Metabolic pathways are complex, multi-structured organizations of proteins and metabolites that promote the continuation and survival of a living system. Through regulation of the proteins that compose these pathways, a robust system enables greater survival in a variety of stresses and conditions. _M. tuberculosis_, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is one such organism. This makes treatment of the pathogen difficult. Generating and using biovisualizations is important for culminating a greater understanding of _M. tuberculosis_ and its mechanisms of regulating gene expression. While there are an abundance of biovisualizations mapping metabolic pathways and protein-protein interactions, there is little work involving the ability to visualize changes in protein expression and impacts of regulations on systems. Additionally, many of these visualizations and other existing visualization tools are based on reference pathways, and are not specific to _M. tuberculosis_. In this paper, a prototype biovisualization of _M. tuberculosis_ metabolic pathways was constructed consisting of three panels: one visualizing metabolic pathway, one displaying protein-protein interactions, and one showing changes in gene expression from a user uploaded file. The tasks and design components were made based on interviews with _M. tuberculosis_ researchers. This work highlights a prospective idea for future metabolic biovisualization work.
